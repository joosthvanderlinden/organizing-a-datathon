### Organizing a Datathon
This repository contains a loose collection of folders, templates and planning documents to organize a datathon. 

#### What is a Datathon?
A datathon is the equivalent of a hackathon for data scientists. You provide the dataset; participants provide insights. What is the value in the data? What are the business opportunities? What corporate or societal problems can we solve with this data? What could the data be connected with to create new insights? Outcomes may include visualizations, insights into specific variables, predictions or analyses involving external datasets. It is up to you to decide how specific you want the theme and associated objectives to be.
